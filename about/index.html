                                <p>I'm Suvrat — a data scientist, builder, and naturally curious human. I enjoy working
                                    on ideas
                                    that blend logic with creativity, and I'm someone who learns best by doing. I've
                                    always
                                    appreciated clean design, honest work, and people who ask good questions. I'm
                                    originally
                                    from India, and now working in the U.S., trying to create things that feel
                                    meaningful. My approach to life is pretty simple: stay curious, work hard, and be
                                    kind.
                                    Whether I'm debugging a model or brainstorming a new project, I like to take my time
                                    to
                                    understand the "why" behind things. I believe in growth, but not at the cost of joy.
                                </p>
                                <p>My approach combines technical expertise with creative problem-solving. I believe the
                                    most
                                    powerful insights often emerge at the intersection of rigorous analysis and
                                    innovative
                                    thinking. Whether I'm building predictive models, creating data visualizations, or
                                    developing end-to-end machine learning pipelines, I'm driven by the potential to
                                    create
                                    solutions that make a meaningful impact.</p>
                                <h3 class="about-heading">How It All Compiled.</h3>
                                <p>Tech came into my life like a quiet wave — slow at first, then all-consuming. I began
                                    learning to code in high school, curious about what made things tick. That early
                                    spark
                                    turned into a full-blown career as I studied engineering, explored data science, and
                                    started
                                    building real-world tools. I found a rhythm in systems, algorithms, and
                                    visualizations — in
                                    making the abstract feel intuitive. Now I work on everything from AI assistants to
                                    computer
                                    vision tools — and I still get excited about learning something new every day.</p>
                                <h3 class="about-heading">W.O.W — World Outside Work.</h3>
                                <p>I like keeping life simple — but full.<br>
                                    Music is where I return to myself. I write, sing, and
                                    play guitar whenever I can. Some songs have found a home on Spotify. Others live
                                    quietly in
                                    my voice notes — raw, unfiltered, just for me. It's less about perfection, more
                                    about
                                    presence.<br>
                                    I've always been drawn to stories. The ones that stay with you long after the
                                    credits roll or the final page turns. Books that shift your perspective. Films that
                                    stir
                                    something deeper.<br>
                                    And then, there's travel. I don't chase landmarks. I follow feeling. The
                                    stillness of a quiet street. A café where no one knows your name. The space between
                                    where
                                    you are and who you're becoming. Stepping away from routine helps me reconnect —
                                    with
                                    myself, with new ideas, with the world as it is.<br>
                                    These moments outside of work don't just
                                    ground me. They shape how I show up — more present, more curious, more human.</p>
