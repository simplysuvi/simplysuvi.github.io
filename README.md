### Who I Am

I’m **Suvrat Jain** - a Data Scientist and AI Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real problems. With experience across machine learning, computer vision, LLMs, and AI product development, I bring together engineering, creativity, and a deep sense of curiosity in everything I do.

Outside of work, I like to sing, read, stargaze, and travel. I believe in designing not just solutions, but experiences - whether that’s through clean code, a compelling product, or a song that resonates. 

My work spans:
- Applied ML & AI development (LLMs, RAG, CV)
- End-to-end product engineering (APIs, cloud deployment)
- AI-powered tools for workplace and creative productivity

This site is my digital home - a place to tell my story, share what I’ve built, and show what I care about.
